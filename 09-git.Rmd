# Git and Github

## Git setup

Set up your git signature globally (for all repositories):

```sh
 
# Customize your git signature
# copy and paste on Terminal

git config --global user.name "Andrea Melloncelli"
git config --global user.email andrea@vanlog.it
```

## add a remote to the repository

Prerequisite: create a new RStudio project with git, with at least a commit


From the empty github repository:
Advice: select HTTPS protocol

```sh
# or push an existing repository from the command line

# just in case, remove 'origin' if it already exists
git remote rm origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/andreamelloncelli/R-for-data-science-2022-collaboration.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# verify the correct configuration
git remote -v
```

## RStudio Operations with CLI

CLI means Command Line Interface, which is the "Command Prompt" on Windows, the Bash on Linux and MacOS.

```sh
# get the status
git status
# upload the latest modifications
git push
# download the latest modifications
git pull
# history
git log
# go to the branch main
git checkout main
# create a new branch
git branch work-in-progress
# move on that branch
git checkout work-in-progress
```



## Troubleshooting via CLI


### Pull

`pull` is the equivalent of:

```sh
# download the latest modifications, without using them
git fetch
# merge you main bronch with the remote version
git merge origin/main
```

Therefore if a conflict happens during a `git pull`, it is a merging conflict. You can abort the merge falling back to your version of main with:

```sh
git merge --abort
```

or decide to use other's version of a file with:

```sh
git checkout --theirs path/to/file
git add path/to/file
git merge --continue
```

See [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10697463/resolve-git-merge-conflicts-in-favor-of-their-changes-during-a-pull) for more information.


If you want to lose your latest commits (not only the working directory changes) and use the upstream version (origin/main version) you can run:

```sh
# backup your main branch
git branch main_bak
# update to 'origin/main'
git fetch
# BEWARE THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION IF YOU DID NOT MAKE
# THE 'main_bak' branch correctly:
git reset --hard origin/main
```

To find your old version:

```sh
git checkout main_bak
```
